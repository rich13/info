# Info

A really simple CMS.

## Warning

This is a hack. If you like it, please make it better... but keep it minimalist :-)

## Installation

- Hasn't been tried from scratch yet

### For Dropbox sync

- Go to <https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps>
- Choose 'Create an app'
- Choose 'Core API'
- Give access to "App folder" not "Full Dropbox"
- Note the key and secret, and add them to the config file...

## Known issues

- Dropbox syncing doesn't work for subdirectories, so all files have to be at one level
- Subdirectories generally, actually...
